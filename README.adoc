= Ansible playbooks to support a RHHI installation

== Introduction.

This is a set of ansible playbooks that helps speed up the installation of a RHHI cluster.

These playbooks help with:

- Creating a custom ISO that contains kickstart files to automate RHHI installs.
- Post install modifications to the hosts, prior to running the deploy wizzard.

== Preparation.

Check out this repository somewhere.

Modify the inventory file per your requirements.

In each group of hosts (add as many as you need) you need to set at least te hostname, and the "ipindex"

=== Important variables in the inventory file.

. `admin_vlan` and `storage_vlan`
+
RHHI requires a storage and an admin network.
These playbooks were written for an environment that uses vlans, so add the correct VLAN tags.

. `admin_cidr` and `storage_cidr`
+
Add the network ranges used.

. `ipindex`
+
IP adresses for the hosts are automatically generated, using the ipindex parameter.
For example, an index of 11 means that the host will get the 11th IP address in the networks defined by admin_cidr and storage_cidr.

. `domain`
+
Domain name to add to hostname to cerate a fqdn.

. `admin_dns`
+
DNS hosts in the admin network.

. `datadrives`
+
List of drives that will be ignored during installation.

. `installdisk`
+
The disk to install the OS on.
Try to use an unambiguous reference, like `/dev/disk/by-path/...`

. `ISOfile`
+
The ISO file used as basis.

. `Workdir`
+
Workdir to use.

=== Template files
. `grub.j2` and `isolinux.j2`
+
Creates an entry for each host in the boot menu. Changes will probably not be needed here.

. `rhvhks.j2`
+
Creates the custom kickstart file. If you need additional functionality in your kickstart add it here.

. `storage_bridge.j2` and `storage_vlan.j2`
+
Create the storage networks.
You may need to change this.
These playbooks were created for an environment where all ethernet interfaces were bonded together in on bond.

=== Other files

. `ntp.conf`
+
NTP configuration that is copied to each host. Change if needed.

. `HP_repo` and `RHVH_repo`
+
Two repositories, on for HP Raid tools, and the other with the RHV-M appliance package.
RPMs are placed here, and run createrepo.
+
I you are not using local repos just remove the relevant lines from prepare.yaml

== Creating the ISO

The iso is created using the `mkiso.yaml` playbook.

----
ansible-playbook mkiso.yaml
----

At the end the a `RHVH_custom.iso` is created.

== Installing the RHV-H hosts using the custom ISO.

Boot the server using the custom ISO.
From the boot menu select the host (by hostname) you wish to install.

The host will go through an unattended install.
OS will be installed on the disk you defined, hostname will be set and the admin network will be configured.

== Prepare the hosts for the RHHI deploy.

----
ansible-playbook prepare.yaml
----

This will do the following:

. Add copies of prepared local repositories to the RHV-H hosts.
+
This is a workaround for the fact that here there was not satellite, and the hosts had no internet access.
The repositories were prepared in advance.

. Create a ssh key for the root user, and copy it everywher.

. set up the storage network.
